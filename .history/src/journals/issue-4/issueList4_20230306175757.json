      "abstract": "In light of the increasing concern about social and ecological crises facing humankind, this experimental study uses nudge theory to examine whether Investor Profile Questionnaires can be redesigned so that retail investors are nudged towards investments that place social and ecological returns ahead of financial returns, and away from investments that (merely) seek to maximize financial returns. Contrary to our predictions, our findings indicate that adding sustainability-oriented awareness and attitudinal nudges to Investor Profile Questionnaires did not result in participants decreasing the proportion of funds they invested in business-as-usual firms that focus primarily on maximizing financial returns. However, as predicted, the awareness and attitudinal nudges did increase the proportion of funds invested in firms that compromise financial returns in order to optimize social and ecological well-being. Moreover, investors’ attitudes towards sustainable investing were more positive after they received an action nudge versus (merely) an awareness nudge. Implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "With the changing trends in business, it is essential to understand how different actors involved in a campaign enable a brand’s objective. This study aims to understand how internal stakeholders of advocacy campaigns can lead to a positive outcome in terms of external stakeholders’ social well-being, particularly in advocating gender well-being. This study utilized qualitative data collection methods to gather perspectives from both internal and external stakeholders to understand how the roles and responsibilities of internal stakeholders collectively help initiate brand advocacy campaigns. In this study, collaborative networks, partner selection, and research and development were assessed with respect to the co-development business model that leads to positive gendered well-being. It was found that there is an existing tension between the normative aspects of beauty and the internal perceptions of consumers. However, respondents shared that the advocacy campaigns facilitated by both influencers and ambassadors as part of the Dove Philippines projects launched in 2020 and 2021 were effective, since they enhanced their self-acceptance, self-esteem, and self-empowerment. The findings from the study can be used as a foundation for future research regarding influencer and ambassador marketing in the Philippines. In addition, it provides a practical application of the co-development business model not only to achieve mainstream business and marketing goals, but more importantly, advancing well-being.",

        "abstract": "This study compares the best and worst-performing hotels from Discovery Hospitality Corporation (DHC), a Philippine hotel group, based on their crisis responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs a polar-type multiple case study research design using qualitative data gathered through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with semi-closed questions. The data was analyzed to assess the viability of key indicators that compose organizational resilience. Proactive consideration of external conditions is imperative for a hotel to be resilient and to survive in a pandemic. The external conditions that were found to be important in this study are: (1) location of the hotel, (2) population in the geographical location, (3) access points, and (4) government regulations. The authors propose that organizational resilience in the pandemic context relies on the following insights: (1) the interdependence of adaptive capacity, planning, and proactive consideration of external conditions; (2) clarity and discipline in serving a concrete target market; and (3) partnerships across private and public sectors. The research findings and key outcomes are interpreted as theoretical insights in the context of the operating environment of the case. This study also suggests that moral actions do not necessarily go against the need to manage internal resources efficiently – both can lead to resilience.",

        "abstract": "Workplace friendships (WPF) are informal and voluntary relationships, different from hierarchical relationships where there is a leader-and-subordinate association. Literature suggests that workplace friendship-type relationships influence innovative behaviour (IBE), yet there are varying results on its impact on entrepreneurial intention (EIN). Accordingly, this research builds on existing studies on these variables, exploring the mediating effect of innovative behaviour on workplace friendship and entrepreneurial intention. The investigation employed a quantitative, descriptive, causal, cross-sectional survey among 278 Philippine-based MSMEs. The results reveal that workplace friendships influence both innovative behaviour and entrepreneurial intention, and as shown in the model, innovative behaviour fully mediates workplace friendships and entrepreneurial intention. The study also illustrates that internal camaraderie, support and trust promote creativity and encourage innovation",

The book is based upon the work of Mary C. Gentile who started the Giving Voice to Values (GVV) movement in 2009. The book is well-written and easy to follow, providing a good overview of the principles of the GVV framework and how it can be applied to help board members address ethical issues in their organizations. It also includes several case studies illustrating how the GVV framework has been used in practice. Overall, Giving Voice to Values in the Boardroom is a valuable resource for board members who want to ensure that their organizations operate ethically"
