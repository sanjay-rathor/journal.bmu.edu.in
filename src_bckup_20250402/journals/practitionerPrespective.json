      "Business schools have been teaching business ethics in one form or another for decades, yet the continuation of corporate scandals seems to point to the futility of these efforts. The question as to whether business schools can truly mould the ethical inclination of students remains paramount. Many educators who believe that schools can affect change in this area have called for a rethinking of how business ethics is taught. A pedagogy and a curriculum that focuses on developing people's capacities to act on their ethical values effectively in any setting, Giving Voice to Values provides a different approach to the ethical analysis methodology traditionally employed in business ethics classrooms."
